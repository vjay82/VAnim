2. The moving controls

This is a new function...
When you activated the buttonpulser, you can move buttons when you hold down shift and move your mouse over a button you will understand it.
After you moved a button VAnim generates a ini-file with the program-name in the VAnim\movedControls\.
You can manipulate directly the ini-files or delete them to reset the positions.
The buttons will be identified by its caption when you moved a button and on next application-start the
buttoncaption changed, it wont be found.

3. Bugreports

Please report bugs to Vjay@gmx.net with writing "Bug" in the headline. 
Describe it as good as you can maybe it would be good to attach your configs and a screenshot.

AND please be aware of the fact that this program is ALPHA! 
This program uses Window-Blinds style-technics, so i dont know if it runs together.
Even some programs could crash when u exit VAnim.exe, look at point 4 to see why.
